### Democratizing Data? Critical Data Studies in Algorithmic Governance  
*Instructor of record*, graduate course in the School of Social Policy and Practice, University of Pennsylvania (Fall 2021, Fall 2022, Fall 2023).

The advent of digital technologies and the increasing power of computational analytics has enabled new possibilities for social analysis and governance. This “data revolution,” as characterized by Rob Kitchin, has challenged paradigms from the philosophy of science while opening new interests in transparency and social activism. This course will examine the emergence of democratizing data -- the movement to make government and other data more publicly available and its potential for enabling democratic possibilities. We will explore the types of data being made available, through various analytic systems, and the ways in which their accessibility and inaccessibility is reconfiguring power relations. Topics such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, predictive analytics algorithms will be discussed in relation to questions pertaining to race, gender, class, sexuality, and disability.

### American Gothic Literature  
*Instructor of record*, University of Pennsylvania (Spring 2022).

Buried alive. Driven mad with guilt. Dissolved into a vast, anonymous universe. These are some of the terrors that our course will address as we explore the aesthetic, philosophical, and historical dimensions of nineteenth century American gothic literature. How did gothic writers complicate cultural attitudes towards the unthinkable, the cruel, and the perverse in works of supernatural horror? What do enduring tropes of gothic fiction like haunted houses, doppelgangers, and sentient machines reveal about the massive social and economic changes of the nineteenth century, including the expansion and intensification of slavery, the expropriation of Indigenous land, and the economic transition to industrial capitalism? And what might the gothic genre fail to capture about these underlying political realities? Our historical attention to race, labor, and gender will enable us to reconsider canonical American gothic literature and illuminate our continued reliance on gothic tropes for representing the uniquely disturbing experiences of modern life.
