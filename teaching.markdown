    <h3>American Gothic Literature</h3>
    <p><em>Instructor of record</em>, University of Pennsylvania (Spring 2022).</p>
    <p>This upper-level undergraduate course explores what the enduring tropes of Gothic fiction like haunted houses, doppelgangers, and sentient machines reveal about the massive social and economic changes of the nineteenth century. Our historical attention to race, labor, and gender will enable us to reconsider the literature of American horror and illuminate our continued reliance on gothic tropes for representing the uniquely disturbing experiences of modern life. </p>
