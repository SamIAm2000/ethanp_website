**Ethan A. Plaue** is a literary and intellectual historian of media, science, and technology. His research foregrounds the interpretative devices that American writers from the colonial era to the nineteenth century used to make sense of their relation to others and to the world. His current book project is an intellectual history of mediation told through the literature and archives of transnational American Romanticism. Crafted out of Enlightenment science and philosophy, the etymologically linked concepts of “mediation,” “medium,” and “means” became seminal metaphors for nineteenth-century political economists, liberal philosophers, and Romantic writers to describe human existence as produced and perpetuated by means of another—whether another person, object, or even idea. Assembling a diverse array of sources—from American Transcendentalism to Black technical writing, from the Patent Act of 1790 to early photography manuals—the book tracks the emergence of mediated life as it shaped not only nineteenth-century ways of knowing but also the way we experience our mediated age today. An article drawn from the book is forthcoming in *PMLA*.
 

His other research and teaching interests include Romanticism in the Americas, global histories of capitalism, comparative race and colonialism, and critical AI and data studies. His article, “The Parasitical Trick: Mediating Dispossession in Early America,” appeared in *American Literature* and received an Honorable Mention for the Norman Foerster Prize in 2023. Other scholarly and public-facing writings have appeared in *Discourse: Journal for Theoretical Studies in Media and Culture, Early American Literature*, and *e-flux*. He received his Ph.D. in English with a Certificate in Media and Cinema Studies from the University of Pennsylvania.
